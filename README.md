Docker and docker-compose class
===============================

Note about working user variables: you should export two variables at host machine â€” `DUID` (docker user id), variable with your current user ID and `DGID` (docker group id), variable with your current group.

These variables are uses for launch php-process in a container.

For example:    
```shell script
export DUID=$(id -u) && export DGID=$(id -g)
```
